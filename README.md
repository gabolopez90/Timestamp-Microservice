# Timestamp-Microservice

For the Free Code Camp Api Projects

Developed using [c9.io](https://c9.io) ide.

For this challenge I used Express.js to serve the static files and manage the query and Moment.js to handle the dates. 

### User Stories:
- I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either an unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
- If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
- If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
